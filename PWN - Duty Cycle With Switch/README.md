## Question

**Switch :**

Create a PWM waveform with frequency = 100KHz and variable duty cycle.

The program should begin with d = 50%.

On pressing one switch the duty should be increased by 5% and on pressing other switch it should be decreased by 5%.

**Duration :**

Implement the same but using only 1 switch (SW1 OR SW2) â€“ short press for d increase and long press for decrease.
