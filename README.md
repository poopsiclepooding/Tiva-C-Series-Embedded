# Tiva-C-Series-Embedded

## Introduction
This repository contains various embedded system code examples for the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad. Each folder in this repository contains a Code Composer Studio project that demonstrates different peripheral functionalities and interrupt handling techniques, such as GPIO interrupts, PWM, SysTick interrupts, and UART communication. The code is properly commented, and a detailed explanation of each example is provided in the respective README or PDF file in each folder.

## Overview
This repository showcases different embedded programming techniques for the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad, focusing on practical applications and real-world use cases. The code examples cover:

1. **GPIO Interrupt LED Toggle** - This example demonstrates how to use GPIO interrupts to toggle an LED on the Tiva C Series LaunchPad. When a button or external signal is pressed, the interrupt will trigger and change the state of the LED.
2. **PWM Duty Cycle with Switch** - This code generates a PWM signal with adjustable duty cycle using a switch input to modify the PWM behavior. It shows how to use PWM for controlling devices like motors or LEDs.
3. SysTick Interrupt Mode - LED Switching
4. SysTick Polled Mode - Waveform Generation
5. UART - Bitbanging GPIO Pin
6. UART - Communicate with Computer
7. UART - Transmit and Receive
8. Printf and Trace Implementation

For each example, you will find the corresponding Code Composer Studio project along with detailed documentation. The code is well-commented to help you understand each step and how it works with the Tiva C Series microcontroller.


## Requirements
To run these examples, you'll need:

Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad
Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE
TI Drivers and Libraries for Tiva C Series
You can download Code Composer Studio and necessary drivers from the official Texas Instruments website.
