# Tiva-C-Series-Embedded

## Introduction
This repository contains various embedded system code examples for the **Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad**. Each folder in this repository contains a Code Composer Studio project that demonstrates different peripheral functionalities and interrupt handling techniques, such as GPIO interrupts, PWM, SysTick interrupts, and UART communication. The code is properly commented, and a detailed explanation of each example is provided in the respective README or PDF file in each folder.

## Overview
This repository showcases different embedded programming techniques for the Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad, focusing on practical applications and real-world use cases. The code examples cover:

1. **GPIO Interrupt LED Toggle** 

2. **PWM Duty Cycle with Switch** 

3. **SysTick Interrupt Mode LED Switching**
   
4. **SysTick Polled Mode - Waveform Generation**
   
5. **UART - Bitbanging GPIO Pin**
    
6. **UART - Communicate with Computer**
    
7. **UART - Transmit and Receive**
    
8. **Printf and Trace Implementation**

For each example, you will find the corresponding Code Composer Studio project along with detailed documentation. The code is well-commented to help you understand each step and how it works with the Tiva C Series microcontroller.


## Requirements
To run these examples, you'll need:

1. Tiva C Series TM4C123G LaunchPad

2. Code Composer Studio (CCS) IDE

3. TI Drivers and Libraries for Tiva C Series

You can download Code Composer Studio and necessary drivers from the official Texas Instruments website.
